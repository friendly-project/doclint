# Doclint

Doclint is a set of rules for linting documentation files. It helps ensure that documentation is clear, consistent, and follows established standards.

This is part of the [friendly! project](https://github.com/friendly-project), aimed at creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface for all users, across various platforms, displays and input methods.

## Getting started

Currently, only [English (EN)](Standards/EN.md) is supported.
