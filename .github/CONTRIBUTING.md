# Contributing

Thanks for thinking about contributing to Doclint! We have a few guidelines to make sure contributions meet the bar for quality and consistency.

## New rules

If you want to propose a new rule, please create a new issue using the "Rule proposal" template. This'll help us understand your idea better, and ensure it aligns with the project's goals.

When filling out the template, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

- A description of the new rule in one or two sentences
- An explanation of what issue it'll fix
- Examples of writing before and after the rule is applied
- If possible, some example of where this rule fixed the issue described above
  - Good examples include techniques from the W3C, or examples from well-known style guides
  - Bad examples include personal opinions or anecdotal evidence

## Pull requests

If you're ready to implement a new rule or fix an existing issue, please open a pull request. Make sure to:

- Update the documentation as needed
- Reference the issue your pull request fixes
  - All pull requests should be linked to an issue, even if it's just a minor fix. This makes separating general discussion from development easier.

Pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers, and we might request changes or provide feedback. Please be patient, as we want to ensure all contributions meet our quality standards.

**Note to maintainers:** All pull requests should have a branch name that reflects the issue type, number, and a short description. For example, `feature/123-new-rule-description` or `bug/456-fix-typo`.
